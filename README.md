YAG_Fluorescence_calibration.ipynb- This is the main script that follows the process of obtaining the fluorescence map from a TIFF.
XRD_FULL_CORRECTIONS.py- This contains a class that the main script calls to from on high.
XRD_CALIBRATION folder- This contains all of the tiffs and PONI files that the code needs.

None of the code is commented :) enjoy.
